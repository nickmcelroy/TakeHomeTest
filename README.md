# TakeHomeTest
This is a take home technical assessment from Hudl testing my ability to use selenium to run basic automated tests on the Hudl login page

The steps to run these files is as follows
    1. navigate to 'TakeHomeTest' file
    2. sudo pip3 install selenium (only once)
    3. For each file use the following command to run test, 'python3 filename.py'
    4. The test will run and once it has run the terminal will prompt you to hit enter to finish the test and exit,
        this is because the driver was quitting on me before running the test so it is a little work around
    5. If you get a message saying that it has passed or failed
    6. Run through steps 3-5 for each of the respective files.
